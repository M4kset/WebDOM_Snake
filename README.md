# Web/DOM snake

In school for the final project there was choosen the web pages and coding topic, (even though, the whole class was about programming in general) there was the general page, that was about the student, and the other part, a free to choose one, so I decided to make a snake game, I was doubtful about since I never done something resemmblant to it, but after a quick prototype I made, I decided to give it a go. 

~~You know, instead of something more easy, and at the end I got 8.3 as the final grade :(~~

*The project is as complex as the original snake*

  <strong>Before you do something, I have to clarify that this project, is entirely in spanish (Yes, I did check the files this time ü§£üëç) and I don't think it is hard to understand why.
  </strong>
</p>

After downloading an opening the main file (index), you will be received by a black window, the title, sliders and a bunch of squares, a button and a large white box, lwt me explain each of them.

1. The title: is the title.
2. The sliders: allows you to change the 2 parameters available:
    - The grid size
    - Execution speed/"FPS"
3. The score: Each time you collect an apple or the red thing, your score increases.
4. The squares: Its where the main program executes and "draws".
5. The button: When clicked, the game runs and the "player head" appears at the farthest square to give him/her some time to react.
6. The white square: This one was a debug thing, but I forgot to delete it üòÇ, it stores in a array the position of the player parts, such as the head and the body parts and displays there.

  In the image above, you can see everything in action, the snake head has a different color just to see where it is, nothing special.
